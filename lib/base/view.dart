/// We extend this class when defining our Views for our pages and screens or

/// After you sort of get this, take a look at example/example.dart

///    void initState() {
///      super.initState();
///      widget.presenter.view = this;

  /// This takes a model and calls for the framework to call the build method,
  /// or in other words, re-draw itself to show any updated changes.
  void setModel(M m) {
    setState(() {
